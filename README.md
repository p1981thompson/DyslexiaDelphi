# Definition of and identification criteria for dyslexia

There is already consensus that dyslexia is primarily a difficulty learning to read and spell. Persistent and sometimes severe difficulties in word and non-word decoding (reading accuracy) are typically observed in children with dyslexia. Secondary consequences of dyslexia may include problems in reading comprehension and reduced reading experience that can impede growth of vocabulary and background knowledge. While some older children and adults with dyslexia continue to experience word level reading problems, others mainly have difficulties in reading and writing fluency, and in spelling.

In devising the statements for this Delphi consensus study, the focus is on areas of debate concerning further potential elements of a definition of dyslexia and criteria for its identification.
